# AAstarter
[Forked from olivluca](https://github.com/olivluca/AAstarter)

This app waits for a trigger, which I do via tasker, and starts Android Auto instructing it to connect back to AAGateway.

You can build it or get it from the [Releases](https://github.com/north3221/AAstarter/release) section and you have to install it on the master phone.
